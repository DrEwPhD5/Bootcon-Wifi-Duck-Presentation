# Bootcon-Wifi-Duck-Presentation
This presentation was submitted as my final project for the cybersecurity certification program at the University of Texas at Austin. 
For my presentaion, I chose to build a USB Rubber Ducky device that could perform remote code execution wirelessly using Ducky Script from Hak5. 
In my presentation you can view my process from planning all the way to using the device to establish a reverse shell on various operating systems.
